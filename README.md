# Toy Search Server

This repository contains a minimal Axum-based HTTP server that demonstrates how an inverted index works. It supports indexing documents and running simple term queries, but is not intended for production use.

The goal of this project is to provide a small, readable example of how the underlying data structure operates, how documents are tokenized, and how basic TF-IDF ranking can be implemented.

Features are intentionally limited. The code prioritizes clarity over completeness.
